# RiSEEventSPL-FH


A FeatureHouse version of the RiSEEvents software product line.


## About the RiSEEventSPL

The RiSE Event is an SPL which aims to develop a product line, that comprises the papers submission in conferences, journals, and related events, and its management, including the control over the review life-cycle, as well as, the management of activities (workshop, tutorial, panels), users (speakers, organizers, reviewers), registrations, payments and certifycates. It was built based on the main features found on largely used conference management systems, such as: EasyChair, JEMS and CyberChair. It constitutes a core asset base integrating many features to make it suitable for several conferences. Thus, based on this common base, the products can be derived.

The SPL was developed using the JAVA language following the MVC architectural pattern and an remote instance of MySQL database. The SPL with 34 functional features has 26.457 lines of code, 1493 methods and 496 classes.

## Repository Organization

There are two folders: _ObjectOriented_ and _FeatureHouse_. The former holds the conditional compilation version of the product line, whereas the latter holds the FetureHouse refactored version.
